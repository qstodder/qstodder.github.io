    <div class="section-content">
      <h3>West Maui Mountains</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Waihe'e Ridge Trail<ul>
          <li>5 mi out n back</li>
          <li>Beautiful ridge views, I just DO NOT recommend when rainy/muddy. </li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Iao Valley State Park<ul>
          <li>Varied lengths</li>
          <li>Beautiful area to learn about ahupua'as, swim in the river, and/or hike around.</li>
          <li>There's some established hikes, but it's also fun to just walk up the river till you find a place to hang/swim.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Lahaina Pali Trail<ul>
          <li>5 mi between east and west trail heads</li>
          <li>Hike up to the wind turbines and get an amazing ocean view the entire way.</li>
          <li>Do it as an out n back, or take two cars to end at the west trail head.</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Hana Side</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Twin Falls<ul>
          <li>Waterfall/river hike in Haiku, on the way to Hana</li>
          <li>One main out n back trail, and many different waterfall side quests. Plan for many hours here, it's a great spot to hike, swim, and hang.</li>
          <li>Parking's no longer free and is super strict unfortunately.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Bamboo Forest<ul>
          <li>Usually pretty rainy and wet, but it's a fun spot to romp around.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Hana Highway Lavatube<ul>
          <li>Fun stop along the Hana drive if you can find parking here.</li>
          <li>There's lava tubes to explore and a river/waterfall to hike up as well.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Wai'anapanapa Coastal Trail<ul>
          <li>Beautiful coastal trail in one of my favorite state parks.</li>
          <li>There's a couple blowholes too!</li>
          <li>Warning - parking reservations are now requried.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Waimoku Falls<ul>
          <li>3.4 mile out n back</li>
          <li>Incredible trail through bamboo forests and rainforest, up to a big 'ol waterfall.</li>
          <li>It's technically in the Haleakala National Park, so there's an entrance fee. If you visit Haleakala Natn'l Park you can use the same pass here within 72 hours!</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Up Country</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Waihou Spring Forest Reserve - 2-3 mi<ul>
        <li>Lush forest loop with an optional side quest into a gulch with "lava" tubes (they're actually old irrigation tunnels, but calling them lava tubes is more fun).</li>
        <li>My fourth grade class planted to koa tree at the top of the gulch trail!</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Haleakala Crater<ul>
        <li>Hiking the crater is a must in my opinion.</li>
        <li>One classic route is the out n back into the crater called Keonehe'ehe'e (Sliding Sands) which takes you from the very top into the center of the crater. You can take it as far as you'd like.</li>
        <li>Another option is continuing along the crater trail out the west side and finishing up some switchbacks at the Halemau'u trail head. This one is a full 12 mi, and is one of the most incredible hikes I've ever done. I wish I could erase my memory and hike it for the first time again.</li>
        <ul><li>Stop at the Holua Cabin part way through for a pee break and lunch.</li>
          <li>NOTE: this is point-to-point so you'll need two cars, or you'll need to hitchhike back to the top at the end.</li>
          <li>If you have a guide, you can also find the lava tube entrances near the Holua Cabin which are an exciting way to test your claustrophobia.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The crater also has many other side quest hikes, but I haven't done them all.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Wailea Side</h3>
    <ul><li>La Perouse (King's Highway)<ul>
      <li>Out n back over the last lava flow on Maui. </li>
      <li>Lots of coves along the way to hang and swim.</li>
      <li> Great snorkling!</li>
    </ul></li></ul>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-header">Surf</div>
    <div class="section-content">
      <h3>West Side</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Thousand Peaks (Ukemehame)<ul>
          <li>Longboard break with lots of little peaks. Also has a parking lot with porta potties.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Lefts<ul>
          <li>Longboard break with an obvious left (obviously).</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Olowalu<ul>
          <li>Mostly a longboard spot, but do NOT pass the chance to bring a shortboard here on a good south swell.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Launiupoko<ul>
          <li>Love this spot so much I'll go even when it's trash.</li>
          <li>Longboards recommended, and be ready to see some turtles!</li>
          <li>Super cute grassy park too, with real bathrooms and a *shower*.</li>
          <li>This is an awesome spot to hang for awhile, have a BBQ with your people, and pop in-n-out for surf sessions.</li>
          <li>If you go out, just be weary of the shallow reef!</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Breakwall (Lahaina Harbor)<ul>
          <li>Where I grew up surfing! Solid all-day longboard spot, just be ready to manuver around surf schools.</li>
          <li>As of Spring 2025 the area is still closed from the fire.</li>
          <li>Park in Kamehameha Iki parking lot (if spaces), otherwise check street parking or the large lot across the street.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>S-Turns (Pohaku)<ul>
          <li>Great spot for your high volume shortboard on a south swell. Otherwise grab the trusty log.</li>
          <li>It never seems crowded but that might be due to it's sharky reputation (I haven't seen any but don't say I didn't warn you).</li>
          <li>Park in Pohaku lot.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Honolua<ul>
          <li>I've actually never been but it's a famous right on Maui and comes highly recommended.</li>
          <li>I'm also unsure how one gets down the cliff to the beach break. This advice is a "get what you paid for" situation.</li>
        </ul>
      </li></ul>
      <h3>North Side & Hana</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Kahului Harbor<ul>
          <li>Never had an epic day here, but I've heard it can happen.</li>
          <li>You can choose the windy trash outside the harbor, or the more-sheltered trash inside the harbor.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Kanaha<ul>
          <li>Windy as heck (world-famous for wind sports), but outside the reef can really go off (gun or log recommended, and a really good leash).</li>
          <li>The park has great parking, bathrooms, vball courts, and so many CATS!</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Ho'okipa<ul>
          <li>Some are wary of the locals here, but just know your etiquette and they'll be the friendly bunch you've ever surfed with.</li>
          <li>Careful of the reef, it bites back.</li>
          <li>Oh, and DON'T TOUCH THE TURTLES.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Jaws (Peahi)<ul>
          <li>Worth a looksie if it's going off!</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Honomanu<ul>
          <li>Only place I've surfed in Hana, and I spent more time fighting the current than surfing. But Shaun had fun!</li>
          <li>Four wheel drive (or close-enough) recommended for the road down.</li>
        </ul>
      </li></ul>
      <h3>Kihei & Wailea</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Maalaea Harbor<ul>
          <li>Never surfed it, but I know it's a great shortboard spot on a good south swell!</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The Cove<ul>
          <li>Don't be fooled by it's lake-like appearance; with the right attitude you can catch anything!</li>
        </ul>
        <li>La Perouse<ul>
          <li>My dad says you can surf here ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</li>
        </ul>
      </li></ul>

      <h3>Up Country</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Surfing Goat Dairy"<ul>
          <li>Behind the scenes tour of some adorable goats and some killer cheese.</li>
          <li>There's also a cafe on sight for lunch!</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Kula Lavendar Farm<ul>
          <li>Very peaceful and beautiful lavendar garden with a cafe and giftshop.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Star Gazing<ul>
          <li>Star gazing is excellent anywhere away from city lights, but Poli Poli is a great location for it.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Poli Poli Disc Golf<ul>
          <li>Beautifully-maintained course. A must if you're a disc-golfer.</li>
          <li>Be careful to not lose your disc in the dense foliage.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Haleakala Crater<ul>
          <li>Definitely a must-see if you're on-island. I also highly recommend watching the sunrise and/or sunset here.</li>

        </ul>
        <li>Olowaly Petroglyphs<ul>
          <li>Drive up a mostly dirt road, and park off to the side once you reach some rocky cliffs.</li>
          <li>Walk down the road and you'll see the petroglyphs in the cliff rocks (look closely, they're pretty pale).</li>
          <li>There aren't too many to see, but it's definitely worth a quick visit if you're driving by!</li>
        </ul>
